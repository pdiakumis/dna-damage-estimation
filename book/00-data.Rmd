# Data Description

We have run the damage estimator on the following samples from the Tothill A5 batch:

```{r}
data_path <- file.path("../data/out/A5")
data_path %>% 
  list.files(pattern = "tot_damage.tsv") %>%
  str_replace("_chr21_tot_damage.tsv", "") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename(sample = value) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

A chr21 subset was generated from these files with the following command:

```bash
samtools view -h ${sample}.bam -b > ${sample}_chr21.bam
```
