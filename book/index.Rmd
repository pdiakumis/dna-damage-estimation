# Introduction {-}

Here we'll describe a few code tweaks to the DNA Damage Estimator (DDE) toolkit
developed by Laurence Ettwiller (https://github.com/Ettwiller/Damage-estimator and
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6326/752.long). We are interested in
running this tool on all the UMCCR samples processed with bcbio, so it is important
that we keep the runtime low.

* Section \@ref(dde-summary) has a detailed summary of the DDE functionality
* Section \@ref(dde-issues) has a few simple ways we can save computational
  time when running DDE

## Required Software {-}

```{r knitr_opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
```
